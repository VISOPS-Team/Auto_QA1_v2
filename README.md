autoQA1_v2
This is an updated version of Auto_QA1.
Weâ€™ve developed a Python script that summarizes the PPK statistics and the Pix4D Quality Report, following the same approach as the original Auto_QA1.
Please note that it requires AWS CLI credentials and access to the Skycatch buckets.

Steps:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run python Auto_QA1_v2.py
Enter PUUID of the job you want to QA1
