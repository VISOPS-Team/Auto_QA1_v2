# Auto_QA1_v2
This is an updated version of Auto_QA1.
Weâ€™ve developed a Python script that summarizes the PPK statistics and the Pix4D Quality Report, following the same approach as the original Auto_QA1. (https://github.com/bdmatabang/autoQA1/tree/main)
<br>Please note that it requires AWS CLI credentials and access to the Skycatch buckets.

Steps:
1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run python Auto_QA1_v2.py
3. Enter PUUID of the job you want to QA1
